# TWDickson_Pico

Theme for my personal website. This is all work by [@Alexandre Negrel](https://github.com/negrel). This theme attempts to bring forth the resume aspect and focus more of the developer site.

## CSS & Theme

Most of PICO's style's, theme and css is driven by Tailwind CSS. Therefore you will not actually see much code as this is compiled and injected into the static site.

It's useful to have some idea how tailwind css works.
[Tailwind  Cheat Sheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) will help. As well as the [official site](tailwindcss.com). Personally I feel cheat sheets are enough unless you really want to dive into how it functions.

Of PICO's SASS files the only useful one is [_variables.scss](assets/sass/_variables.scss) where the theme colouring is defined. Others seem to be various template controls though I am not sure.

### Colours

Defining colours has been problematic. PICO uses a "class" [dark mode toggle](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually). This means that colours can be defined using something like so:

```html
<div class="some classes dark: border-pink-600">
```

Theme colours are defined in two places:
[tailwind.config.js](/themes/pico/assets/config/tailwind.config.js) and [_variables.scss](assets/sass/_variables.scss).

## Site Structure

The home page and barely has any logic in it's template file, [index.html](layouts/index.html) simply calls the widgets:
Order is controlled in `content\lang\home\widget_name.md` by setting flags in the header, primarily `weight` and `hidden`.

The content of these "widgets" is defined by [patials/widgets/widget_name](layouts/partials/widgets/).
